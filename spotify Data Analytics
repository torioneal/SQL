--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

--Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL
select * 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--What is the average danceability by artist? 
select artist_name, avg(danceability) 
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name;

--and track?
select track_id, avg(danceability)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by track_id;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
select artist_name, avg(popularity) as avg_pop
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by avg_pop desc
limit 10;

--What artist released the longest song?
select distinct artist_name, duration_ms
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by duration_ms desc
limit 1;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? 
select track_name, avg(danceability)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by track_name
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

--Who are the top ten artists based on energy?
select artist_name, avg(energy) as avg_energy
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by avg_energy desc
limit 10;

--which artist has the most songs in the top 50 on this list and how many songs do they have on the list?
select distinct artist_name, count(track_name) as num_songs
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by num_songs desc
limit 1;

--How many songs does Lil Nas X have on this list?
select artist_name, count(track_name)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
where artist_name = 'Lil Nas X';
